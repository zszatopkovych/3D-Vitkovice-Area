Copyright & Trademarks

No portion of this web site or the service may be reproduced in any form, or by any means, except as authorized below, without prior written permission from Trimble Inc.

1. Acceptance of Terms Through Use; Changes to Terms of Use
Welcome to 3D Warehouse. Trimble Inc. (“Trimble”) makes available 3D Warehouse and any other element of this website or subdomains (collectively, “3D Warehouse”) only upon your acceptance of these Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OR ACCESSING 3D WAREHOUSE OR DOWNLOADING OR ACCESSING MODELS. YOUR USE OF 3D WAREHOUSE INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THE CURRENTLY POSTED TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT USE 3D WAREHOUSE.

Changes to Terms: Please note that Trimble reserves the right to update and change these Terms of Use from time to time in its discretion and will post a notice on 3D Warehouse when these Terms of Use have changed. Please also check these Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of 3D Warehouse following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Use will confirm your acceptance of those changes. These Terms of Use constitute a binding, legal agreement between you and Trimble and are intended to have the same force and effect as if you signed them. 3D Warehouse and other services are only available to persons who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. If you do not qualify, you may not use 3D Warehouse. A current copy of these Terms of Use can be accessed and viewed at any time from the home page of 3D Warehouse or at https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/tos.html.

2. Use of 3D Warehouse
Subject to these Terms of Use, you may use 3D Warehouse to view, search, locate, download, and Distribute Models. Trimble reserves the right to refuse access to 3D Warehouse to anyone at any time in its sole discretion.

“Models” are individual, separate three-dimensional models of objects created, designed, and developed by you or a third-party (a “Developer”) or by Trimble and include related content and information about or included with the Models. Trimble is not responsible for any Developer Models. “Distribute” means to submit, upload, distribute, sell (upon Trimble's implementation of payment systems) and/or license Models you have created to end users.

Currently all Models are made available and Distributed through 3D Warehouse free of charge. If Trimble implements a payment system, Trimble will post additional terms to these Terms of Use describing the ways in which Models may be purchased and sold through 3D Warehouse.

To download and use the Models, you need software that is compatible with the Model (for which Trimble or the applicable manufacturer may charge a separate fee) and a computer device with Internet access; such requirements may change from time-to-time and are your responsibility.

3. User Accounts
Account Creation.
Upon signing in to 3D Warehouse the first time, you need to create an account. Currently, you may create a 3D Warehouse account by signing in with a valid Google ID (a username/password combination used to access your Google account) or Trimble ID (a username/password combination issued by Trimble). To sign in using a Google ID, you must authorize Google to share account information with Trimble and you must maintain your Google ID in good standing subject to any separate user terms between you and Google. The authentication information Google provides to Trimble or you provide to Trimble may contain personally identifiable information, which will be handled by Trimble as described below, and we may publicly display the username and profile photo (if any) associated with your Trimble or Google user account.

You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account credentials, and you agree that Trimble may terminate your access to 3D Warehouse and other services if you fail to do so. Additionally, you are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Trimble immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Trimble will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge.

Your Personal Information.
Personally identifiable information that you may submit for the purpose of receiving products or services or for creating or authenticating your user account will be handled in accordance with Trimble’s online Privacy Statement, and may be used or shared by Trimble as necessary to fulfill your access to a Model or provide any related services or as otherwise set forth in these Terms of Use.

4. Age Restrictions
You may not register for a user account or use 3D Warehouse to Distribute Models if you are under 13 years of age unless we have verified parental consent.

5. Third Party Models, Products and Services
Some of the 3D Warehouse Materials (defined below in Section 10) may be provided or owned by third parties. Trimble does not endorse, guarantee or provide a warranty for the third party 3D Warehouse Materials and may or may not review them for compliance with law (copyright, patent or any other laws) or Trimble policies. Use of a third party Model is governed by the License Terms Applicable to Models set forth below. TRIMBLE DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO MODELS POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES (AND ANY ACTION YOU TAKE BASED ON THEM).

6. Trimble Proprietary Products and Services
Trimble’s obligations with respect to its own, proprietary products and services are governed solely by the terms and conditions of agreements under which Trimble provides them to you. If you obtain a Trimble proprietary product or service through 3D Warehouse that is provided without an agreement, that product or service is provided “AS-IS” with no warranties whatsoever, express or implied, and your use of that Trimble product or service is at your own risk.

Nothing herein grants you any license, rights, title or interest in or to the Trimble SketchUp software which is licensed to you pursuant to a separate agreement (“SketchUp License Agreement” ). Trimble may update, fix or upgrade the SketchUp software from time-to-time without notice and such changes may affect compatibility or interoperability of your Model. Your right, if any, to receive such updates, fixes or upgrades is dependent upon and governed by the terms of the applicable SketchUp License Agreement between you and Trimble.

7. License Terms Applicable to Models
Your use of a Model you download or use is governed by these Terms of Use and the General Model License available here (“General Model License”). Any Model provided under the General Model License is provided “AS-IS” with no warranties whatsoever, express or implied, and your use of that Model is at your own risk.

8. Availability of Models
Trimble or any Developer may modify, update or remove any Model they have published to 3D Warehouse at any time in their discretion. Trimble may also remove any Model from 3D Warehouse if it discovers that such Model (or related Developer) violates these Terms of Use, any other Trimble policy or applicable law.

9. Distribution of Models through 3D Warehouse
Qualifications and Distribution Terms.
Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use and any applicable Developer guidelines, qualifications and requirements of Trimble for Models (“Qualifications”), you may Distribute your Models to end users through 3D Warehouse, and you will then be deemed a “Developer” under these Terms. Trimble is not responsible for any Models you Distribute.

Trimble may in its discretion set and revise from time-to-time Qualifications regarding the criteria and procedures for Trimble to accept and authorize each Model submitted for Distribution through 3D Warehouse. Trimble may choose to waive or impose additional Qualifications for a particular Model in its discretion. Trimble may decline to make a Model available on 3D Warehouse for any reason or no reason.

Until such time as Trimble has implemented payment systems for 3D Warehouse, you are free to charge for Models you Distribute via other channels, provided that you are solely responsible for any such activities. In such cases, you shall be solely liable for processing end user payments, administration of applicable refunds or chargebacks and remittal and collection of all applicable taxes. If Trimble implements payment systems for 3D Warehouse, your sale of Models shall be subject to the subsequently released version of these Terms of Use.

You may remove a Model you previously posted from 3D Warehouse at any time provided that removal shall not affect the license granted to end users who downloaded that Model before you removed it and those licenses will continue under the terms of the General Model License. Although Trimble will not continue Distribution of your Models after you remove them, Trimble may retain archive copies for record keeping purposes.

Grant of Licenses. Distributors grant two licenses to their Models as follows:
To Trimble. For all Models you Distribute on or through 3D Warehouse, you hereby grant to Trimble a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, transferrable (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers), irrevocable license (under all applicable intellectual property rights) to copy, publicly perform and display, use, distribute, create derivative works of, store, promote, market, support, transmit, and otherwise make available on or through 3D Warehouse each Model and related content, including without limitation as necessary to promote, operate and make available 3D Warehouse and any related Trimble products or services. The foregoing license includes the rights for Trimble to make available Models (or any parts, related content or derivative works thereof) through Trimble’s partners and sublicensees.

To the End User. You will make your Models available to end users pursuant to the General Model License.

Title and Ownership.
As between you and Trimble, except for the limited license rights granted herein, all right, title and interest in and to the Models you Distribute shall remain yours.

Trimble Not Responsible for Your Models.
Trimble does not and will not endorse, guarantee or provide a warranty for your Models and may or may not review them for compliance with law (copyright, patent or any other laws) or Trimble policies or Qualifications. Distribution of your Models on 3D Warehouse is at your own risk.

Any action you take based on any rating is at your own risk and in your sole discretion.

If you post a review of your own Model, you must disclose your identity and the fact that the Model being reviewed is your Model. If you pay or otherwise incent others to post a review of your Model, you must require that party to disclose that fact in their review. If you post a review of a competitor’s Model, you must disclose your identity and the fact that you publish a competitive Model.

Your use or misuse of 3D Warehouse Materials
Distribution of your Models
Violation of the Qualifications
Intellectual property infringement by your Models

17. No Exclusivity
Trimble does not represent or warrant that Models developed by Trimble or submitted by Developers will not contain features or functionality that are the same as or similar to those in other Models available on 3D Warehouse and neither these Terms of Use nor your participation in 3D Warehouse limits Trimble’s or any Developer’s right to develop or have developed for its products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with any Model or any other products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in information you disclose to Trimble. Trimble does not grant you exclusivity of any kind.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INDEPENDENT OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE AND SURVIVES IN THE EVENT SUCH REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE.

THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER DAMAGES ARISE FROM BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT PROHIBIT SUCH EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS, IN NO EVENT WILL TRIMBLE’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50).

By purchasing, downloading, or using any Model created by a third party developer or Trimble (as applicable, the “Developer” ) and made available to you from 3D Warehouse, you agree to the terms of this General Model License Agreement (“License Agreement”). “Model” means the individual, separate three-dimensional model of an object created, designed and developed by a Developer including related content and information about or included with the model and made available on Trimble’s SketchUp 3D Warehouse (“3D Warehouse”).

1. License Grant
Limited License to Models
Subject to the provisions of this License Agreement (including, but not limited to, the license restrictions set forth below), the Developer grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable and non-exclusive license (without the right to sublicense) to download, reproduce, adapt, make derivative works based on, modify, publish, publicly display and perform, distribute, make, sell, offer to sell, import, and use Models for the uses expressly authorized below. Please see the 3D Warehouse Terms of Use FAQs for examples of these authorized uses. If you desire to use the Models in a manner not expressly authorized in this License Agreement, you must submit a request to Trimble at 3dwarehouse-tou@sketchup.com and receive Trimble’s prior written consent before doing so.
